SUMMARY
-------

This package provides a reference parser and database importer for the
United States Senate LD-1/LD-2 lobbying disclosure database. The
Senate provides the database as a series of XML documents,
downloadable here:

http://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/database_download.htm

Note that the 1996-98 files can be purchased directly from the Senate office for 
$315. Not sure why they don't post them on the internet. These were the early 
years of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. My guess is that compliance 
with the law was not too great then anyhow.

The SQL database schema used by the importer is a direct translation
of the XML schema used in the Senate documents. This is
useful for finding anomalies in the files and for making the data available to other 
software. The XML files are very large and the database is relatively 
easier to access. In any case, it shouldn't be too
difficult to create new tables from the data that can be analyzed. Another use is 
to supplement and check the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) version of the which is missing 
many of the variables (e.g. SOPR registrant ID, their physical address, etc.).
The CRP data can be downloaded in bulk here:

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This package requires Python 2.5.1 or later.


SCRIPTS
-------

See the Howto.txt for a short script that will take a directory of the Senate's XML files 
and insert them into a database.

The lobbyists-benchmark script loads one XML document into a database,
and reports the amount of time required to a) parse the document and
b) import the parsed records into the database. It's mainly
interesting for developers working on the lobbyists package itself.
